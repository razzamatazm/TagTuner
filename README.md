# TagTuner music player
TagTuner is a device that enables you to access music playlists or albums using NFC tags.\
It only works when integrated with Home Assistant media players. Music Assistant music library is optional. This setup seamlessly blends your digital only music collection with the tactile experience of playing a physical record, tape or cd.\
Physical music media offer several advantages:

- it's easy
- it's fast
- it's inclusive

TagTuner is made with [ESPHome](https://www.esphome.io) and includes

- an NFC reader
- a dial with a button
- a LED light

All of this is housed in a sleek, custom design case only 16mm high

## Getting started
To start using TagTuner, you’ll need the following:
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) 2025.12.x
- [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io) 2.7.x or [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/) speaker 
- configured MAss music [library](https://music-assistant.io/usage/#the-library) and/or a streaming subscription 
- TagTuner device configured in HAss
- any NFC tags or programmable NTAG213/215/216

![8D01B378-9F47-4FF3-8D71-280600690BE8_1_102_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cab0a534-d01e-4579-b5ea-96b6a81d9edc)


Assuming you already have Home Assistant (HAss) with Music Assistant (MAss) or Sonos set up and running, TagTuner supports [Improv via Serial](https://esphome.io/components/improv_serial) and [Improv via BLE](https://esphome.io/components/esp32_improv) for Wi-Fi configuration.\
Home Assistant will automatically detect your new TagTuner as ESPhome device.\
In the Diagnostic panel of TagTuner you can see detailed state of your device.\
Simply place any NFC tag and watch Status messages.\

## Build your own TagTuner

### Case
Custom model cases are print-ready

- [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1109660)
- [ko-fi/shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/ce428ab53f)

Choose and print your enclosure with preferred colors and surface patterns. \
I suggest a cool-white (signal white) base and a dark front plate with a nice carbon fibre pattern.
![D7EFA920-1D9A-4D65-AD23-4F0A2328A510_1_105_c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea6c62d3-68ee-47b1-8d40-b381910d00c3)

### BOM for XIAO-Custom version
- [XIAO esp32-c6](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3hnW7jV) controller with built-in antenna
- [pn532](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3l9MKHr) NFC reader
- [grove angle connectors](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2RsQTy5) any HY2.0-4P will do
- [grove cables](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4UAtrRb)
- [hw040](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3vSH4wJ) rotary encoder
- [dupont cables](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4FUMZi7) for hw040
- [M2.5 10mm](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3gFU5Zv) screws

#### Wiring XIAO-Custom
pn532 connector (use grove cable):
- GND: GND (bottom cable)
- VCC: VBUS (+5V, bottom cable)
- SDA/TXD: D4
- SCL/RXD: D5

hw040 connector (use dupont cable):
- CLK: D8
- DT: D9
- SW: D10
- +: 3V3 (+3.3V)
- GND: GND

![IMG_3879](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89939c33-9ba4-458e-9037-983e964e1784)

Route and solder the VCC (red) and GND (white) wires along the bottom side of XIAO to ensure the front LED remains unobstructed.

XIAO will fit perfectly into the bottom part braces
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/729de545-c39a-4701-8ef3-378c20e3397d" />

Built-in LED is used as confirmation light. Print the led peg with clear filament and it will give great results \
![IMG_4109](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4353100e-4f89-4b26-94c9-b5832e30e6c0)

I prefer soldering the grove angle connector to the PN532 NFC board
![CA3A603C-CE5B-4982-AF24-9E40D3E554C2_1_201_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/977e082d-af23-4d34-a981-68bd14b8df44)

Just use the force ;-)
![528C987E-321C-4D8D-81F6-45F3D853613B_1_201_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/248ef825-9c18-4447-9822-559ca3267cb7)

Remember to set the DIP switches to 10 to enable I2C. Correct switches position for I2c is marked by yellow lines.

Everything will fit into the enclosure.
![IMG_3884](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/486370be-21fa-4e10-a11b-db0cf5e78d17)

Use 10mm M2.5 screws (nfc board, volume encoder, front plate).

### Firmware

- [quick start](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner/#installation): use pre-built firmware with [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) powered installer [here](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner/#installation)

- [Atom version](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/blob/main/TagTuner-Atom.md): based on m5stack Atom Echo and grove connectors; free model case but much thicker (23.5mm)
- [Compact Case](https://makerworld.com/pl/models/1455126-tagtuner-compact-multi-use-case-rfid-nfc-scanner-ha): card-sized case by Youddha (thank you!)

## Using TagTuner
TagTuner relies heavily on Home Assistant automation. To get it working, import **TagTuner for HAss** blueprint

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fluka6000%2FTagTuner%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2FTagTuner4HAss.yaml)

Create automation with this blueprint.\
Select your TagTuner device (you can have more than one!) and media player that will be your speaker \
<img width="1048" alt="AA88EF99-C0A6-40CE-A8F9-60A0C926069F" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1a081c-0f3c-4adc-a19b-ac921e2a9050">

I do a monthly updates of the blueprint. You can watch my repo to get email notifications. \
Current list of features:

- separate settings for MAss player and HAss player (http sources). If you don't need double setting, just set the same player in both
- Stop music on tag removed: choose if you want this
- Announce every playlist: you can choose your TTS engine and TagTuner will use your speaker to read artist and playlist names
- Shuffle every playlist: choose if you want this. You can also add '/shuffle' (without quotes or spaces) at the end of the source URI to shuffle just this album
- Volume limiter: to limit the maximum volume set with TagTuner knob (kids friendly!)
- Default volume on start playing
- Notify about version mismatch: shoose if you want HA dashboard notification that your blueprint version is to new vs your TagTuner yaml firmware. Currently there are no breaking changes so this is future proofing the blueprint and your experience

<img width="1046" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afe982a8-cde0-4c9f-8c76-17ba57b1427b" />


![B459D72A-3B97-4AFB-BF86-19F3298A521F_1_102_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b11ebfa-5114-451c-a7fb-fdaacd612d1b)

### Playing music
Place your tag flat on the TagTuner or use the slot to position it nicely.\
TagTuner will read the tag and send the playlist information to Home Assistant. Using automation, HAss will play music on the speaker you've set up for this TagTuner.

### Button operations
**Single click**: next \
**Double click**: play/pause \
**Long click** (>1s): mute/unmute \
**Triple click**: previous

### Volume control
Rotate the dial left: **volume down** \
Rotate the dial right: **volume up** 

### Feedback
Watch the LED light in the button: \
**blink**: operation confirmed \
**flashing constant**: writing operation in progress \
**flashing few times**: operation success

XIAO-Custom has a single color led so it's only blinking but it's really easy to understand what's going on. Use HAss device Diagnostic dashboard in case you would need status info.

### Diagnostic
Check the Diagnostic->Status messages on the device page in Home Assistant.\
The ladybug icon is your guide.

![AA29C1D0-BE96-452C-B2BF-FDD8AF05B9F1_1_102_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa49e88-7832-40c9-b8ea-dc481e9369fa)

### Plex videos on Apple TV
Tags can also start a Plex movie or show on an Apple TV. Music tags keep working as before.

Setup:
1. Add the Home Assistant **Plex** and **Apple TV** integrations.
2. On the Apple TV, open Plex, go to Settings > Remote Control and turn on **Advertise as Player**. With Plex open, check that a Plex media player for the Apple TV shows up in HA (press the Plex "Scan clients" button if not).
3. In the TagTuner automation, open **Plex videos on Apple TV** and pick the Apple TV and its Plex player.

Video tags hold `plexvideo://` followed by a Plex search in JSON. Library and titles must match Plex exactly.

| Tag | Plays |
| --- | --- |
| `plexvideo://{"library_name":"Movies","title":"Moana"}` | the movie, resuming where it stopped. Add `"year":2016` if two movies share a title |
| `plexvideo://{"library_name":"TV Shows","show_name":"Bluey"}` | next unwatched episode, then keeps going. Random once everything is watched |
| `plexvideo://{"library_name":"TV Shows","show_name":"Bluey","shuffle":true}` | random episodes |
| `plexvideo://{"library_name":"TV Shows","show_name":"Bluey","season_number":1,"episode_number":3}` | that episode |

To write one, import [TagTunerWriteVideoTag.yaml](blueprints/TagTunerWriteVideoTag.yaml) as a script blueprint, create a script from it, run it, fill in the fields and place a tag on the reader within 30 seconds. Take the tag off the reader before running it: a tag already sitting there is skipped, for writing and erasing alike. You can also type the URI into the reader's Playlist URI box and press Write Tag.

While a video tag is the last tag scanned:
- click: play/pause
- turn the knob: skip back/forward (Plex's own step)
- hold and turn: Apple TV volume (the volume limiter doesn't apply)
- lift the tag: keeps playing
- put the same tag back: resumes if paused
- scan a music tag: pauses Plex and plays the music

If the Apple TV is asleep it gets woken and Plex opened first, which can take a while. If Plex doesn't show up or won't play the title, you get a Home Assistant notification.

## How to get tags for TagTuner
### Upcycle tags you already have
Use whatever nfc tags you have that work with PN532. \
Simply scan them with TagTuner and check you HA tags panel. \
Try Amiibos, NFC rings, work badges, etc. \
You can even [recycle a Sonicare](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/blob/main/Recycled-tags.md) toothbrush head 🤙

Check [the read-only tags](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#for-read-only-tags) section below.

### Buy tags
Choose NTAG215 (504 bytes) or NTAG216 (888 bytes) tags if you want to include the playlist name and artist. Otherwise, NTAG213 (144 bytes) will suffice for just links to playlists

- [Plain white cards](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Deb0eeV)
- [Wooden cards](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdGYnJf)
- [Round stickers](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DB8U8dB)

Record-like cards can be printed (model file included) or you can buy those nice looking [vinyl coasters](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooVfjuN). Just remember to put NFC stickers on them ;-) \
Stickers can be used with 3d printed cards or any other object you can place on your TagTuner to play music.\
I use Canon KC-18IF card-sized labels to customize my wooden NFC cards.

### Program tags for Music Assistant
If your speaker is one of Music Assistant media players, your tags need to have a MAss URI.\
[Here](https://music-assistant.io/faq/how-to/#get-the-uri) you can find instructions on how to get URI for the playlist or album you want. In the latest versions you can basically copy the URI directly from the Provider details section for that media.

On the TagTuner device page, you'll find all the fileds nesesary to write the playlist URI to your tag \
<img width="324" alt="38842E5D-4B81-4B88-8815-FD35B67D8357" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6e480e0-020a-49a8-b126-f4356e159fbc">

Minimum information needed is URI.\
Fill in the Playlist URI -> click _Write Tag_ -> LED starts flashing red -> Place the tag on TagTuner \
Successful writing will be confirmed with green light.\
Check Diagnostic->Status for any additional information.

### Program tags for Sonos
If your speaker is Sonos media player, your tags can have a plain HTTP playlist URL.\
[Here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118235) you can find instructions on how to get the album or playlist url for Apple Music. Just copy it.\
It should work the same with [Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/share-from-spotify)

On the TagTuner device page, you'll find all the fileds nesesary to write the playlist URL (URI) to your tag \
<img width="324" alt="15B48F29-212B-4739-B62A-51EE45BEE9E9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d261f6-6072-48a3-a82e-9534b6e2f28d">

Minimum information needed is URL.\
Fill in the Playlist URL -> click _Write Tag_ -> LED starts flashing red -> Place the tag on TagTuner \
Successful writing will be confirmed with green light.\
Check Diagnostic->Status for any additional information.

### Other options
You can also write your tags with any NFC NDEF tag writer, such as NXP NFC TagWriter for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tagwriter-by-nxp/id1246143221) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter)\
<img width="300" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b83d0674-f327-4714-a7f2-4a0d5ad110c7">
 or 
<img width="300" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a5d697c-b908-4e5f-bd08-c8537ef37f93">


### More options
#### for Sonos
You can also play any Sonos app favorite playlist, album, or station!\
Simply write the name of the playlist or station exactly as it appears in the Sonos app.\
Then, enter sonos-2:// in the URI field.\
<img width="324" alt="864038B7-970D-4120-AF52-DD503CA11BEE" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11dc3202-3d7b-46df-b1f6-7557bd2f7015">

#### for read-only tags
If you have any read-only tags that can be read by TagTuner (give it a try to check), you can use them too!\
To set the playlist URL, place it as the name of the tag in HAss panel \
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your tags.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/tags.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/tags/)\
<img width="823" alt="D88754F6-5199-47EA-B71D-4B262B060160" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14cdc593-dfa1-4294-a6fa-5aa60a8b0677">

Any tag id read by TagTuner will be pushed to HAss [blueprint](#using-tagtuner) automation.

## A little history
It all began one day back in 2022. \
I've seen all those cool NFC jukebox projects but found myself too lazy to automate each tag individually. \
So, I [contributed](https://github.com/adonno/tagreader/commits?author=luka6000) to the Adonno [tagreader](https://github.com/adonno/tagreader) project to enable it to push playlist URLs as HAss events. \
[Here's](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tagreader-jukebox-old-dog-new-tricks/407855) original story posted on Home Assistant communities.\
Since then, TagTuner has been completely refactored and physically redesigned.
